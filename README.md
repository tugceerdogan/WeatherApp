# WEATHER APP

My goal was to create an application that a WheatherApp.

### Meanwhile, I used the following technologies :

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) Dagger Hilt

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) ViewModel - Livedata

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) Retrofit

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) Fragments

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) Navigation

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) ViewBinding

![#e96525](https://via.placeholder.com/15/e96525/000000?text=+) FusedLocationProviderClient


The project has been designed using the desired structures, but the problem has not been solved yet due to the error in the api access and time constraints.
